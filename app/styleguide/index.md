# Tony Robbins Styleguide
This guide is meant to provide a visual and code reference for most styles and UI components available throughout the application. Components and utilites are organized into categories, which can be found within the navigation menu.

The code found accompanying the visual example of each component is intended to serve as a genericized example of that component's styled markup, and may be copied and pasted for conversion to .NET controls.
